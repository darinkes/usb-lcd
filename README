= USB System LCD for small OpenBSD appliances

This is the sourcecode of a little private project to add a systeminfo
LCD to my OpenBSD home firewall.

It has three Parts:

1. a) Commandline-Interface to controll an AVR via USB
      This tool is able to send commands to the AVR with an own "designed"
      protocol.
   b) Firmware for the AVR

2. Background-Service
  This tool sends in a constant frequent data to the AVR, which shows
  them on the LCD.

3. Local small system-monitor
  This tool shows you information about your system and the choosen
  network interface. Very useful if you have a very minimal userland
  installed and so no top, trafshow etc. available.

= included/needed software

The AVR sourcecode uses parts from V-USB (http://www.obdev.at/vusb/)
which is published under the terms of the GNU General Public License
Version 2 (GPL). See firmware/USB-License.txt for details.

To compile you need libusb installed.

= Building and Executing

1. Commandline-Interface and Background-Service to controll an AVR via USB
  a)
    $ cd commandline/
    $ make clean && USB=1 make
    => brings us four executables

  b) The stripped executable is for very small appliances and saves
     some space.

   - Files: gslcd and gslcd.strip
     Is the Background-Service for constant updating the LCD

   - Files: usblcd and usblcd.strip
     Commandline-Tool to control the AVR

2. Local small system-monitor

  $ cd commandline/
  $ make clean && make gslcd

  Execute it and tell the network-interface via -i
  $ ./gslcd -i re0
